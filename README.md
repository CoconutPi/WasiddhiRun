# Wasiddhi Run
<p>This literary running game tells history of (Thai) Buddhism through Wasiddhi's, or women's, perspective. Wasiddhi is a female character from Danish literature, Der Pilger Kamanita. In this game, Wasiddhi needs to avoid touching monks, otherwise she will be sinful because monks are not allowed to touch or to be touched by women.</p>
<p>Player's health is represented by "Boon Points" or merit points. When she touches monks, she loses 1 Boon. To gain 1 Boon, she can pick up lotus and pray at a temple. When her Boon reaches 15, she will become a man. Then, she can instead "high-five" monks and gain Boons. This bonus mode lasts for 30 seconds. The player turns back into a woman. Another bonus level is when monks are female monks. So she can "high-five" them and gain Boons.</p>
<p>When player's Boon or health reaches 0, she will be swallowed by the earth, i.e. go to hell.</p>
