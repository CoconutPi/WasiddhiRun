# Wasiddhi Run
This literary running game tells history of (Thai) Buddhism through Wasiddhi's, or women's, perspective. Wasiddhi is a female character from Danish literature, Der Pilger Kamanita. In this game, Wasiddhi needs to avoid touching monks, otherwise she will be sinful because monks are not allowed to touch or to be touched by women.
