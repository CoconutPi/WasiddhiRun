## What is it about
<p>
This educational running game depicts (Thai) Buddhism through Wasiddhi's, or women's, perspective. Wasiddhi is a female character from Danish literature, Der Pilger Kamanita. In this game, Wasiddhi needs to avoid touching monks, otherwise she will be sinful because monks are not allowed to touch or to be touched by women.
</p>
<p>
Player's health is represented by "Boon Points" or merit points. When she touches monks, she loses 1 Boon. To gain 1 Boon, she can pick up lotus and pray at a temple. When player's Boon or health reaches 0, she will be swallowed by the earth, i.e. go to hell. 
</p>
<p>
When she has accumulated enough Boons, she will become a man. Then, she can instead "high-five" monks and gain Boons. Another bonus level is when monks are female monks. So she can "high-five" them and gain Boons.
Player can also pick up cards to get into short levels. These card levels present important Buddhist holidays and events.
